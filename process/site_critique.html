	 <h4>Navigation</h4> 
	<p>The website is super easy to navigate, in fact it offers clear headings and options to easily and efficiently find things</p>
   		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>Once again super easy to use, I think it can be used by all ages being it is straightforward.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>I absolutely love the typography from the colors, font, down to the size. All these aspects match the vibes and aesthetic of this band. It is al quite fitting and makes what the user came to look for easy.</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>I love everything from the graphics to the font and color choices of this website. I think knowing the band also helps me better connect with some of the aspects of teh website. However, I think if I knew nothingh about the band this website alone would make me want to learn more.</p>
